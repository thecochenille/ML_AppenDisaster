Appen Disaster Response
=============================================
# Project Summary: 
This project uses the Appen Disaster Response dataset to build a Machine Learning model and to classify messages to 36 emergency response categories.

# Project building process:
The project was built in three main steps:
- Data preparation
- Model building
- Flask App integration (in progress)




# How to use the app


# How to run the scripts 
## Requirements



# Repository files and folders:
## data/

## models/
## app/
